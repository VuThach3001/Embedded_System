# ðŸ“˜ Fundamentals of IÂ²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is IÂ²C?
- **IÂ²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** is a **synchronous, serial communication protocol**.  
- Developed by **Philips (NXP)** in 1982.  
- Uses **two wires only**:
  - **SCL (Serial Clock Line)** â†’ generated by the master.  
  - **SDA (Serial Data Line)** â†’ carries the data.  

Because it only needs **2 wires**, IÂ²C is very popular for connecting multiple chips on the same board.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Roles in IÂ²C
- **Master**: controls the clock, initiates communication.  
- **Slave**: responds to master requests.  
- ESP32 can act as **master or slave**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Addressing
- Each device has a unique **address** on the bus.  
- Typically **7-bit address** (0â€“127).  
- Some devices use **10-bit addressing**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Communication Basics
1. **Start Condition (S)**  
   - Master pulls **SDA low** while **SCL is high** â†’ signals start of communication.  
2. **Address Frame**  
   - Master sends the **7-bit address** + **R/W bit** (0 = Write, 1 = Read).  
3. **ACK/NACK**  
   - Receiver pulls SDA low = **ACK** (acknowledge).  
   - If not acknowledged = **NACK**.  
4. **Data Transfer**  
   - Bytes are sent **MSB first**.  
   - Each byte is followed by ACK/NACK.  
5. **Stop Condition (P)**  
   - Master releases SDA high while SCL is high â†’ signals end.

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Data Rates
- **Standard Mode** â†’ 100 kbps  
- **Fast Mode** â†’ 400 kbps  
- **Fast Mode Plus** â†’ 1 Mbps  
- **High-Speed Mode** â†’ 3.4 Mbps

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Advantages
- Simple (2 wires for many devices).  
- Multi-master and multi-slave capable.  
- Widely supported (sensors, EEPROMs, displays, etc.).  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Limitations
- Slower than SPI (because of clock stretching and addressing).  
- Limited bus length (a few meters max, depends on pull-up resistors and speed).  
- Needs proper pull-up resistors on **SDA & SCL** (typically 4.7kÎ©).  

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Typical Applications
- **Sensors** (temperature, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.).  
- **Displays** (OLED, LCD).  
- **Memory devices** (EEPROM, RTC modules).  
- **I/O expanders** (PCF8574, MCP23017).

## âœ… Summary
IÂ²C is a **2-wire serial bus** where a **master controls communication** with **addressed slaves**.  
Itâ€™s easy, scalable, and widely used for short-distance communication between chips.
